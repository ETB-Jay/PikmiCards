**PikmiCards** is a TCG card picking system originally designed by Michael Zhang for Enter the Battlefield (ETB) using [React.js](https://react.dev/), [tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com/), and [React Router](https://reactrouter.com/).
[Shopify](https://www.shopify.com/ca) is used as the backend for this project. The data was primarily extracted using the company's [GraphQL tool](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql).
