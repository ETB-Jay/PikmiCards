# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature focuses on optimizing the Largest Contentful Paint (LCP) performance metric for the PikmiCards React application. LCP measures how long it takes for the largest visible element to render on the page, which is a critical Core Web Vital that affects user experience and SEO rankings. The current application has several performance bottlenecks including blocking font loads, large CSS bundles, and unoptimized resource loading that need to be addressed to achieve optimal LCP scores.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want the main content to load quickly when I visit any page, so that I can start interacting with the application without delay.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user navigates to any page THEN the LCP SHALL be under 2.5 seconds on desktop
2. WHEN a user navigates to any page THEN the LCP SHALL be under 4 seconds on mobile
3. WHEN the largest contentful element renders THEN it SHALL be visible and interactive within the LCP timeframe
4. IF the user is on a slow connection THEN the critical content SHALL still render within acceptable LCP thresholds

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want fonts to load efficiently without blocking page rendering, so that text content appears quickly and doesn't cause layout shifts.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the page loads THEN fonts SHALL be preloaded to prevent render blocking
2. WHEN fonts are loading THEN fallback fonts SHALL be used to prevent invisible text
3. WHEN custom fonts load THEN there SHALL be minimal layout shift (CLS < 0.1)
4. IF fonts fail to load THEN the application SHALL gracefully fallback to system fonts

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want critical CSS and JavaScript to load first, so that the above-the-fold content renders immediately.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the page loads THEN critical CSS SHALL be inlined or prioritized
2. WHEN JavaScript bundles load THEN they SHALL be split to prioritize critical code
3. WHEN non-critical resources load THEN they SHALL not block the rendering of critical content
4. IF the bundle size is large THEN code splitting SHALL be implemented to reduce initial load

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want images and other media to load efficiently, so that they don't delay the rendering of the largest contentful element.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN images are the LCP element THEN they SHALL be preloaded with high priority
2. WHEN images load THEN they SHALL use modern formats (WebP, AVIF) when supported
3. WHEN images are below the fold THEN they SHALL be lazy loaded
4. IF images are critical THEN they SHALL have appropriate sizing and optimization

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want performance monitoring and measurement tools, so that I can track LCP improvements and prevent regressions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN performance changes are made THEN LCP SHALL be measured before and after
2. WHEN the application builds THEN bundle analysis SHALL be available
3. WHEN performance regressions occur THEN they SHALL be detected in CI/CD
4. IF LCP thresholds are exceeded THEN alerts SHALL be generated
